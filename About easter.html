  <p class="scneaster">Easter is a moveable feast, meaning that its date varies each year. It is preceded by Lent, a period of fasting and repentance for many Christians. The week leading up to Easter is known as Holy Week and includes significant events such as Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday, which commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus. Easter Sunday is often marked by joyous celebrations, including special church services, feasting with family and friends, and the tradition of giving Easter baskets filled with treats. In many cultures, specific foods are associated with Easter, such as hot cross buns and lamb dishes. While religious observances are central to Easter for many, it has also become a secular holiday celebrated by people of various faiths with traditions like Easter parades and the custom of wearing new clothes.
