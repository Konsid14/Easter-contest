  <p class="frsteaster">Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. It is considered the most important event in the Christian calendar. The date of Easter changes each year and is determined based on the lunar calendar, falling on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. Traditional Easter symbols include eggs, which represent new life, and the Easter bunny, a symbol of fertility. Many customs associated with Easter, such as egg decorating, Easter egg hunts, and attending church services, have their origins in ancient pagan festivals celebrating the arrival of spring. Overall, Easter is a time for Christians to reflect on the sacrifice of Jesus and the hope of new beginnings.

  <p class="scneaster">Easter is a moveable feast, meaning that its date varies each year. It is preceded by Lent, a period of fasting and repentance for many Christians. The week leading up to Easter is known as Holy Week and includes significant events such as Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday, which commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus. Easter Sunday is often marked by joyous celebrations, including special church services, feasting with family and friends, and the tradition of giving Easter baskets filled with treats. In many cultures, specific foods are associated with Easter, such as hot cross buns and lamb dishes. While religious observances are central to Easter for many, it has also become a secular holiday celebrated by people of various faiths with traditions like Easter parades and the custom of wearing new clothes.
