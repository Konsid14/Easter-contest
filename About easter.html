  <p class="frsteaster">In addition to the religious significance of Easter, the name "Easter" is said to have derived from Eostre, a pagan goddess of spring and fertility, which is why many Easter traditions are associated with rebirth and new life. The tradition of decorating eggs during Easter dates back to ancient times, symbolizing fertility and new beginnings. The Easter bunny, a popular symbol of Easter, is believed to have originated from German folklore as a symbol of fertility and was brought to America by German immigrants in the 1700s. Easter egg hunts, where children search for hidden eggs, have become a beloved activity during the holiday and are a way to symbolize the search for the resurrection of Jesus. While Easter is a Christian holiday, its celebration has transcended religious boundaries and is enjoyed by people of various beliefs as a time for renewal, family gatherings, and festive celebrations.</p>
  <p class="scneaster">Easter is a moveable feast, meaning that its date varies each year. It is preceded by Lent, a period of fasting and repentance for many Christians. The week leading up to Easter is known as Holy Week and includes significant events such as Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday, which commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus. Easter Sunday is often marked by joyous celebrations, including special church services, feasting with family and friends, and the tradition of giving Easter baskets filled with treats. In many cultures, specific foods are associated with Easter, such as hot cross buns and lamb dishes. While religious observances are central to Easter for many, it has also become a secular holiday celebrated by people of various faiths with traditions like Easter parades and the custom of wearing new clothes.
